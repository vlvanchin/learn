### How to begin Python scripts

- Always start with the bang statement

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

- Ensure to give your python script executable permission

```
$ chmod +x <script-name.py>
```

- You may want to hide what language you are using for the script then rename the script without filename-extension

```
$ cp <script-name.py> <script-name>

```

- to run the script from any folder, then include this path to your PATH variable
```
$ export PATH=$PATH:<folder-name-where-the-scripts-reside>
```
